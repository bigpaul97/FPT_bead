# FPT_bead
First-passage time calculations and simulations 

<OU_FTP_PRE.nb> is a mathematica notebook, containing the calculation of the survival probability, first-passage time distribution, and mean first-passage time, for different values of trap stiffnesses and initial radial separation, using the series solution presented as Eqs. 21, 24, and 25.

<bead_diffusion_in_potential.m> is a MATLAB code for the first-passage time simulations of a single particle trapped in a harmonic potential, diffusing outside an absorbing sphere with a certain initial radial separation.

Detailed code documentation is provided within both files as inline comments.
